# 🌍 AI4ClimateScience : a Quartz-powered website

This repository is the source of my personal [website](https://niccolozanotti.com) where I hold my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)-taken notes. 
This work is based on the [Quartz](#the-quartz-project) project.

## Structure: 
 - the `.md` files using flavored markdown syntax are located in the content/ folder, which is set up as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)[^1]. 
 - Static website files (HTML, CSS, JS) are built through [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
 - The website is hosted on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) Pages.

[^1]: As of now, I opted to keep this a private submodule as I keep all my personal notes in my main Obsidian vault.
