# ðŸŒ±AI4Climate.science : a Quartz-powered website

This repository is the source of my personal [website](https://niccolozanotti.com) where I hold my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)-taken notes. 
This work is based on the [Quartz](#the-quartz-project) project.

## Structure: 
 - the `.md` source files are located inside the `content` folder, which is set up as a [git submodule](https://github.com/niccolozanotti/AI4climate.science-vault). 
 - Static website files (HTML, CSS, JS) are built through [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
 - The website is hosted on [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) Pages.
